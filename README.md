## GNARv2

This repository is intended to be a [React](https://reactjs.org/) re-write and upgrade of the original vanilla JavaScript version of GNAR, which can be found [here](https://github.com/joshwa-moellenkamp/GNAR). Eventually, this app is intended for mobile use leveraging React Native.

In addition to the original application, users and friend groups/local leaderboards are a desired feature for competition on the mountain.

### Deploy Instructions
